p. "Design by Contract":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract based on annotations. It allows easy usage of contracts without any need for extra JVM parameters, JVM agents, special classloaders or compilers. Instead it leverages "dependency injection":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection to capture method calls which are annotation with a contract. The project is highly flexible and can be extended to support new contract annotations and other contract clause definitions (see below).

h2. Usage

p. Contracts can only be specified on methods. The following example shows how to do it:

bc.. public class ContractExample {

    @Contract(
        preconditions = {
            @Clause(value = "damage > 0", message = "Reported damage must be positive!", exception = IllegalStateException.class),
            @Clause("damage <= 5000")
        },
        postconditions = {
            @Clause("return >= 0"),
            @Clause("return <= 2000")
        })
    public double calculateCover(double damage) {
        // .. some calculations
    }

}

p. The above example shows a method with two pre- and postconditions. The first precondition sets the optional message and exception fields, which are used in case the contract clause was violated. See the integration matrix below for a framework/language usage guide.

h2. Integration

p. This library offers several implementations for a variety of other libraries/frameworks. The following configuration matrix shows what is currently supported. Anything missing? "Create an issue!":https://github.com/sebhoss/annotated-contracts/issues/new:
